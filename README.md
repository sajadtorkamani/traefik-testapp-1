# traefik-test

## Getting started

Ensure you've setup the jedi-traefik service from the [traefik](https://github.com/sajadtorkamani/jedi-traefik/tree/master) project.

If you see the Traefik admin dashboard at http://localhost:8080, you should be setup.

Run:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Access http://traefik-test.localhost and you should see a success message.

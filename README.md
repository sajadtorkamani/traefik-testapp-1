# traefik-test

## Getting started

Ensure you've set up the `jedi-traefik` service from the [traefik](https://github.com/sajadtorkamani/jedi-traefik/tree/master) project.

If you see the Traefik admin dashboard at http://localhost:8080, you should be setup.

Once Traefik is set up, run:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Access http://traefik-test.localhost and you should see a success message.
